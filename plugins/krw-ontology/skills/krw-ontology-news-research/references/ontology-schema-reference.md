# Ontology Schema Reference

This reference describes the current KRW ontology object schema for internal research reasoning. It is based on `src/krw_ontology/schema/objects.py`.

Do not expose schema names, field names, object IDs, scores, or internal lineage mechanics in normal user-facing answers. Use this reference to choose the right evidence path and then translate findings into analyst language.

## Global object conventions

Most filing-grounded objects carry these context fields:

```text
id
type
object_type when present
ticker
source_document_id
document_type
period
schema_version
```

Common governance/evidence-quality fields:

```text
confidence
review_status
supported_by_claims
supported_by_quotes
materiality_hint
materiality_basis
specificity_score
boilerplate_score
ranking_score
```

Interpretation:

```text
confidence/review_status = internal quality controls
specificity/ranking/boilerplate scores = internal ranking aids
supported_by_* = evidence lineage hints
```

These fields should guide tool choice and caveat strength, not appear in normal prose.

Important fields:

```text
run_id

## Which schema objects to prefer by question

```text
Exact quote or filing language:
EvidenceQuote -> SourceSpan/SourceDocument

Business model / revenue driver:
CompanyBusinessProfile -> BusinessActivity -> ResearchClaim -> EvidenceQuote

Metric table / growth / share / margin:
MetricObservation -> Calculation -> XBRLFact -> SupportLink

Risk / thesis / headwind / driver:
BusinessFactor -> ExternalFactorExposure -> ResearchClaim -> EvidenceQuote

Direct external exposure:
ExternalFactorExposure with direct support -> ResearchClaim/EvidenceQuote; separate related context from direct evidence

Contract / debt / commitment / covenant:
AgreementTerm -> ResearchClaim/EvidenceQuote

Event / regulatory / milestone / guidance:
BusinessEvent or ChangeEvent -> ResearchClaim/EvidenceQuote

Sector/global/macro read-through:
CompanyBusinessProfile + BusinessActivity + BusinessFactor + ExternalFactorExposure + selected MetricObservation, synthesized across a bounded covered universe
```

## User-facing translation rule

Never answer with schema inventory.

```text
Bad:
ExternalFactorExposure and BusinessFactor objects indicate related_context.

Good:
The covered companies point to input-cost inflation and pricing/volume trade-offs as the main macro pressure channels.
```

Use schema knowledge to choose evidence and caveat strength. Use analyst language for the final answer.
