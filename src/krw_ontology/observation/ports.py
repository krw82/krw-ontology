"""Provider ports for the observation data layer.

These Protocol interfaces are the closed boundary between external data
vendors and the observation store (built in a later task). Values crossing
this boundary are advisory-only market and macro context: never filing
evidence, never strong-claim support, never recommendation or price-target
grounds. Vendor names stay inside this layer.
